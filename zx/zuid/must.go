// mustNil panics if err is not nil.
// mustNil is a defensive assertion used primarily in security-sensitive areas.
// It ensures that an error, which "should never" occur, is truly absent.
// This acts as a safeguard against future changes in upstream APIs.
//
// This is intended to be used with [crypto/rand.Read].
// As noted in the documentation for [crypto/rand.Read], it does not return
// a non-nil error. While we believe this interface will never change,
// we include this check just to be absolutely sure â€” for security reasons.
func mustNil(err error) {
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
